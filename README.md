EDA on bank customer for approving the loan

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.


This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
Identification of such applicant's using EDA is the aim of this case study.
